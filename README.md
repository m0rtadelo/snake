# Snake

A classic Snake game in Javascript. Use the arrow keys of the keyboard to move the snake and get all the fruits. Caution with your body and the limits of the game terrain!

## Installation

Actually this project uses dependencies only for development (linter). The game itself has no dependencies. You only need to clone this repo and edit the `index.*` files.
